# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the authentication system with a multi-step onboarding wizard for new users.

## Components Created

1. **Authentication Client**
   - Created Supabase client in `src/lib/supabase.js`
   - Implemented authentication helper functions (signUp, signIn, signOut, etc.)

2. **Authentication Context**
   - Implemented in `src/contexts/AuthContext.js`
   - Provides authentication state throughout the application
   - Handles session management and onboarding flow trigger

3. **Authentication Pages**
   - Login page: `src/pages/Auth/Login.js`
   - Sign Up page: `src/pages/Auth/SignUp.js`

4. **Onboarding Wizard**
   - Implemented in `src/components/OnboardingWizard.js`
   - Three-step onboarding process:
     1. Personal information (name, country, profile photo)
     2. Genre preferences (5-7 book genres)
     3. AI feature preferences (0-5 features)

5. **Navbar Integration**
   - Updated `src/components/Navbar.js` to show auth-related links and user profile
   - Added profile dropdown menu for authenticated users

## Database Structure

Created a SQL migration script in `supabase/migrations/20240402_user_profiles.sql` that:
- Creates a `user_profiles` table for user information
- Sets up RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- Creates a storage bucket for profile photos
- Configures triggers for automatic profile creation

## Environment Variables

Added the following variables to `.env`:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

## Protected Routes

Implemented protected routes using React Router v6 in `src/App.js`:
- Added a `ProtectedRoute` component to handle auth checks
- Protected book reader pages for authenticated users only

## User Experience

1. New user signs up
2. Onboarding wizard automatically appears
3. User completes 3-step onboarding process
4. User profile is created with preferences
5. User is redirected to the main application

## Mobile Responsiveness

- All components are responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Mobile-specific UI adaptations for the onboarding wizard
- Responsive design implemented using MUI responsive features

## Documentation

- Created `auth-setup.md` with setup instructions
- Created this summary document

## Next Steps

1. Implement profile page for users to view and edit their information
2. Add additional authentication providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
3. Add email verification functionality
4. Implement password recovery flow
