## Placeholder Book Cover

You need to add a placeholder book cover image for books without covers. The file should be named `placeholder-book.jpg` and placed in this directory.

Recommended specifications:
- Dimensions: 400x600 pixels (2:3 aspect ratio)
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: Less than 100KB
- Design: Simple book icon or gradient background with "Storia" text

You can create a simple image using any design tool (like Canva, Figma, or Photoshop) or download a free book cover placeholder from stock image sites.

## Why this is needed

The placeholder image is used by the Storia app when:
1. A book from Project Gutenberg doesn't have a cover image
2. The cover image URL is invalid or broken
3. During loading states before the actual cover is available
