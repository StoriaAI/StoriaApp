# StoriaApp Vercel Deployment Changes

## 1. Configuration Files

### vercel.json
Created a new configuration file with:
- Build settings for both the React app and API functions
- Route configuration for API endpoints and frontend
- Environment variable placeholders for API keys

### package.json
Updated with:
- Added Vercel build script
- Specified Node.js engine requirements
- Added @vercel/node dependency

## 2. API Structure Changes

### Serverless Functions
Created three serverless API functions in the `/api` directory:
- `api/books.js` - Endpoint for fetching books from Project Gutenberg
- `api/read.js` - Endpoint for fetching and paginating book content
- `api/generate-music.js` - Endpoint for generating background music

Each function is completely self-contained with all necessary logic from the original Express server.

## 3. Frontend Code Updates

### React Components
- Updated all API endpoints in `src/pages/BookReader.js` to use relative paths instead of hardcoded localhost URLs
- Ensured proper error handling for API requests
- Maintained full functionality while being Vercel-compatible

## 4. Documentation

### README.md
Updated with comprehensive documentation including:
- Features overview
- Tech stack description
- Local development setup
- Vercel deployment instructions
- Environment variable configuration

## 5. Environment Variables

Configured all necessary environment variables:
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- ELEVENLABS_API_KEY
- ELEVENLABS_API_ENDPOINT
- OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT
- GUTENBERG_API_ENDPOINT

These variables are properly referenced in both:
- The `.env` file for local development
- The `vercel.json` file for Vercel deployment

## 6. Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
- Book browsing works with the serverless API
- Book reading with pagination functions correctly
- Music generation works seamlessly in the serverless environment
- Frontend properly communicates with the backend API

## Next Steps

1. Push these changes to your repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
